## Discussion
I went with a formal, professional tone of voice. In my experience, most airlines still adhere to this. Plus coming across as cutesy and clever in this kind of situation might not be be well received. Travelers are tired, and may be pressed for time and patience. Just the facts, m'am. 

I thought the headline should catch the user's attention and express urgency without alarm (it's not an emergency). I kept the message simple and to the point. I opted not to include an apology due to space constraints, but moreso because I felt an apology by text in this situation is a bit empty. A traveler might simply want to know where to pick up their bags and when's the next flight out. Speaking to an agent, either through the app or in-person, for an apology and for more information seems like the logical next step. I didn't think it made sense to schedule them on another flight since it's bad weather - presumably all flights are cancelled and the airline wouldn't necessarily know when service will resume.
