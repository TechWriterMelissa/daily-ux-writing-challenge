## Discussion
I went with a formal, professional tone of voice. In my experience, most airlines still adhere to this. Plus coming across as cutesy and clever in this kind of situation might not be be well received. Travelers are tired, and may be pressed for time and patience. Just the facts, m'am. 

I thought the headline should catch the user's attention and express urgency without alarm (it's not an emergency). I felt "status alert" is a message the traveler would feel compelled to read. For the body, I kept it simple and to the point. I opted not to include an apology due to space constraints, but moreso because I felt an apology by text in this situation is a bit empty. If I were the traveler, I would simply want to know where I can pick up my bags and when's the next flight out. Speaking to an agent in person for an apology and for more information seems like the logical next step.
