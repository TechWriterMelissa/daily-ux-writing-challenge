## Discussion
Why might someone want groceries delivered *automatically* so infrequently as once per month? Putting myself into the mind of a grocery shopper, I could see the value in an auto-ship subscription for pantry items, since they would likely be the same every month. But fresh meat, cheese, produce and dairy would be purchased fresh on a weekly basis, so it's hard to imagine the value in a monthly delivery for those items.
