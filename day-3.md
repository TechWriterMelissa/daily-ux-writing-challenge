## Worst possible ideas
Hey loser, that's not the right email.  
Oops! That doesn't look right. Try again.  
What did you do this time?  
Wrong email entered. Check for typos.  
Whoops, you did it again!  
Sign in failed.  
Something's not right. Re-enter your email.  
We're unable to sign you in.  
You have failed. Account deleted.  
It's not us, it's you.  

## Playing with copy
Please check your email and try again.(*this doesn't work because "check your email" could mean literally, go check your inbox*)  
Please verify your email and try again.
Please use the email associated with your account (*too long*)  
Please use the email linked to your account.  
Email correct? Please check and try again.  
Account not found. Please re-enter your email.
Please verify you entered the correct email.
Pease ensure you've entered the correct email. 




## Final solution





## Discussion
Since this is a fairly simple one on its face, I started out with a *worst possible ideas* brainstorm to add a little fun to my process and get the creative juices flowing.
