Oops! That doesn't look right. Try again.  
What did you do this time?  
Wrong email entered. Check for typos.  
Whoops, you did it again!  
Sign in failed.  
Something's not right. Re-enter your email.  
We're unable to sign you in.  
You have failed. Account deleted.  
It's not us, it's you.

## Discussion
Since this is a fairly simple one on its face, I started out with a *worst possible ideas* brainstorm to add a little fun to my process and get the creative juices flowing. I played with some different copy ideas. Obviously the biggest challenge is the character limit. I landed on something I think identifies the problem and simultaneously tells the user what they should do to fix it. I wanted to keep the language active voice and positive, avoiding words like "incorrect" or "error".
