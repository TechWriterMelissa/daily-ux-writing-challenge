## UX Writing Challenge: Day 6
### Scenario: It’s Monday. A user has just gotten into their car to drive to work. They plug their phone into the car and start driving.

Challenge: How would you let the user know there’s a fire happening in a nearby town that is causing road closures? The effect on their commute is unknown, but there is a definite danger if the fire gets closer. How do you communicate this to them? When? Write it.  

Headline: 30 characters  
Body: 45 characters max    

## Answer
*Option A - Provincial Emergency Alert. Note: For this option, I did not follow the character limits*

**Alberta Wildfire Emergency Alert**  
Evacuation order issued for the town of Okotoks. Visit the provincial emergency website for information and updates.  

*Option B - Car GPS Notification*  

**Provincial Alert**  
Wildfire evacuation order in Okotoks. Expect delays.  



## Discussion
When I read this scenario, two things came to mind: number one - how and why might a user receive this type of alert? and two - forest fires. In my mind, this scenario could be unrelated to an app on the phone and more likely to be either (a) a provincial emergency alert or (b) an alert that comes up on the car's native GPS system. Although a common way to interpret this challenge is through a mapping app notification, I can't wrap my head around why the driver would receive an alert on a mapping app if they haven't programmed a destination (maybe this is a technology feature I am simply not familiar with, very possible - but I'm just trying to keep these challenges as close to real life as I can). So instead, I explored the two other possible ways this challenge might be satisfied.
