## Discussion
This challenge is all about the user persona. What would motivate someone to buy tickets if they don't usually attend live concerts? For the first version, I tried to tap into some marketing techniques: urgency and scarcity, otherwise known as FOMO (fear of missing out) marketing strategy. I pulled the name of the band and the date/location of the concert out of the character count to allow more space for the value proposition. I liked the first iteration, but it was a lot of copy for one screen. So I played with some different ideas for the second iteration to save space and present an alternate value proposition. I like the first value proposition better, because I think it would have broader appeal. However, if the app is customizing it's value proposition based on user research, this type of music fan might be more attracted to a small venue (granted, the venue location isn't variable).
