## Discussion
This challenge is all about the user persona. What would motivate someone to buy tickets if they don't usually attend live concerts? I tapped into some marketing techniques on this one: urgency and scarcity, otherwise known as FOMO (fear of missing out) marketing strategy. In my first version, I pulled the name of the band and the date of the concert out of the headline and body to allow more space for the value proposition. I liked the first iteration, but it was a lot of copy for one screen, and it was missing an escape option, so I played with some options to get a more complete message in fewer characters.
