## Discussion
This challenge is all about the user persona. What would motivate someone to buy tickets if they don't usually attend live concerts? I tapped into some marketing techniques on this one: urgency and scarcity, otherwise known as FOMO (fear of missing out) marketing strategy. I liked the first iteration, but it was a lot of copy and was missing an escape option.
