## Discussion
I wanted to understand what the appropriate mechanism would be to display game updates on a mobile phone. What is the right visual element for this user interaction, I asked myself. I find often with writing, it helps to first understand how information can or should be structured. That way, I can tailor my copy to fit the context. A quick Google image search pulled up some great examples of how sports apps normally display live updates for users, which is through a widget. I liked this approach because the widget displays key game information, such as score for example, allowing more space in the copy for details about the play. A quick glance at their phone, without unlocking the screen, shows exactly what they want to know.
