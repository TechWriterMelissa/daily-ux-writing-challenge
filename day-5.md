## UX Writing Challenge: Day 5
### Scenario: The user works in graphic design. While critiquing a design in a mobile app, their phone abruptly turns off. When they restart the phone, they reopen the app.

Challenge: Write a message that the user will read immediately upon opening the app. What do they need to know? What steps (if any) do they need to take to recover their content? What if they can't recover the content? 

Headline: 40 characters  
Body: 140 characters max  
Button(s): 20 characters max

## Discussion
For this one, I did most of the copywriting directly in the design until I came up with something that I thought made sense. I see two different problems presented by this challenge. Number one, to let the user know where to find their content. And number two, error prevention so that content is not lost. Here are the things I considered and assumptions I made while I was writing and designing:  

1. The app didn't crash, the phone did. A subtle difference perhaps,  but I worked from the assumption that the app was operating correctly at the time the phone shut off.
2. How might a comments/feedback system actually work for this kind of app? Why would comments be saved or not saved?
3. Content either can or can't be recovered. What are the parameters for each, and what does the user need to know to find their content and/or for error prevention?
4. It didn't seem logical to me that this kind of app would serve an error message alerting the user their comments weren't recovered. If the comments are gone, they're gone. It would make more sense to have something in place to prevent that from happening, such as being signed-in and having comment auto-save enabled. I honestly can't remember the last time any tool crashed on me and didn't recover my work (would have been Microsoft Word or Adobe Illustrator Circa 2013).
