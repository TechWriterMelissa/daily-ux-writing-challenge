### Scenario: The user is trying to view a website to help them buy a car. But, the content can’t load without the user’s location. They need to enter their ZIP code and first name.  

Challenge: Ask them where they live and who they are without sounding like you're unnecessarily mining their data.

## Discussion
My purpose for this challenge was to answer the user's question "why do you need this information from me?"  

I found the context a bit confusing, so I researched similar websites to see how they managed this issue. I didn't come across any sites that asked for a first name and, on most sites, the location was autoset (I assume auto-populated from my browser or IP settings, etc). If the location doesn't populate, or if the location is wrong, the user is prompted to set a location. I imagine the purpose of the location is for accurate pricing and available inventory according to geographic location. However, I'm not sure why the site would require a name — maybe to deter bots? I think my solution fulfills the challenge, but to improve the user experience,  I might recommend not asking for a first name. It could deter or confuse the user and doesn't seem to serve any real purpose.  

I brainstormed some copy ideas and then edited in design for space requirements and flow. For full transparency, the heading "Set your location" is very common among car websites, and I couldn't come up with a better, simpler way to convey the message.
