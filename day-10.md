## UX Writing Challenge: Day 10
### Scenario: The user is trying to view a website to help them buy a car. But, the content can’t load without the user’s location. They need to enter their ZIP code and first name.  

Challenge: Ask them where they live and who they are without sounding like you're unnecessarily mining their data.

## Discussion
I can understand needing the postal code, but why the first name? At first I thought maybe to deter bots? I did some quick research to see what's happening with car manufacturer websites and other sites that list cars for sale. Some of the manufacturers ask for a location, and sometimes the location is autopopulated (not sure if that's from cookies or saved from previous visits). Nobody asks for a name. Of those that ask for a postal code, it's usually a notification served on the home page such as "set your location."
